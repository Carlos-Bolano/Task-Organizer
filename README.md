# Task Organizer üìÉ

## üìñ About The Project

Task Manager is a personal task management application showcasing my web development skills. Built with modern technologies like React, Vite, and Axios, this app allows users to seamlessly create, read, update, and delete tasks. It‚Äôs designed to work fluidly across both desktop and mobile devices, reflecting my focus on responsive design and user experience.

This project demonstrates my understanding of front-end frameworks, API integration, and essential CRUD operations.
